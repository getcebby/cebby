# New Calendar View

We're excited to introduce our new calendar view, making it even easier to find and track tech events in Cebu!

## What's New

The calendar view provides a month-by-month overview of all upcoming events, allowing you to:

- Quickly identify busy days with multiple events
- Plan your schedule more effectively
- Get a bird's eye view of the tech event landscape

## How It Works

Simply navigate to the Calendar tab to switch from the list view to the calendar view. You can click on any day to see the events scheduled for that day.

## Additional Improvements

Along with the new calendar view, we've also made several smaller improvements:

- Improved loading performance
- Fixed several UI bugs
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness

Let us know what you think of the new calendar view! We're always looking for ways to improve Cebby.
