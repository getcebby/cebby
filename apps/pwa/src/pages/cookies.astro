                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This Cookie Policy explains how Cebby ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies
                    on our website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the "Services"). It explains
                    what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please read this Cookie Policy carefully. By using or accessing our Services, you agree to the use
                    of cookies and similar technologies as described in this policy.
                </p>

                <h2>2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
                    website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the
                    owners of the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cookies allow a website to recognize your device and remember if you've been to the website before.
                    They can be used to store your preferences, remember your settings, analyze how you use the website,
                    and personalize content.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
                <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>

                <h3>3.1 Essential Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies are necessary for the Services to function properly. They enable basic functions like
                    page navigation, secure areas access, and account authentication. The Services cannot function
                    properly without these cookies.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Preference Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies enable the Services to remember information that changes the way the Services behave
                    or look, such as your preferred language or the region you are in. They help us to personalize your
                    experience.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Analytics Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with the Services by collecting and reporting
                    information anonymously. They help us improve the Services and your experience.
                </p>

                <h3>3.4 Marketing Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies are used to track visitors across websites. The intention is to display ads that are
                    relevant and engaging for the individual user and thereby more valuable for publishers and
                    third-party advertisers.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage
                    statistics of the Services and deliver advertisements on and through the Services.
                </p>
                <p>These third parties may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analytics providers (such as Google Analytics)</li>
                    <li>Advertising networks</li>
                    <li>Social media platforms</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. How Long Do Cookies Stay on Your Device?</h2>
                <p>
                    The length of time a cookie will remain on your device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or
                    "session" cookie:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Session cookies:</strong> These cookies are temporary and expire once you close your browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> These cookies remain on your device until they expire or are
                        deleted. The length of time they stay on your device will depend on the cookie's purpose and function.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Cookie Management</h2>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you
                    limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, as it
                    will no longer be personalized to you.
                </p>
                <p>Here's how you can manage cookies in the major web browsers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Settings > Privacy and security > Cookies and other site data</li>
                    <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data</li>
                    <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences > Privacy > Cookies and website data</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge:</strong> Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Cookies and site data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For mobile devices, you can usually manage cookies through the settings in your mobile browser, or
                    you may need to refer to your device's documentation.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Similar Technologies</h2>
                <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies on our Services, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Web beacons:</strong> Small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that
                        may be included on our Services and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users
                        and user behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Local storage:</strong> Similar to cookies, but with a much larger storage capacity. Local
                        storage is not transferred to the server and is stored on your device until cleared.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update our Cookie Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the
                    new Cookie Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are advised to review this Cookie Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Cookie
                    Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
