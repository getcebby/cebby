                    <p>
                        At Cebby, we're building more than just an events platformâ€”we're creating a community. Our
                        mission is to connect people with amazing events and experiences in Cebu, and to do that
                        effectively, we need to ensure our platform is a safe, respectful, and inclusive space for
                        everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These Community Guidelines outline the standards we expect from all members of the Cebby
                        community, including event organizers, attendees, and general users. By following these
                        guidelines, you help us maintain a positive environment where everyone can discover and share
                        great events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe in the power of events to bring people together, spark creativity, and strengthen
                        communities. These guidelines are designed to support that vision by ensuring that Cebby remains
                        a platform where everyone feels welcome and respected.

                        We evaluate each situation individually and consider factors such as the severity of the
                        violation, the user's history, and the context of the situation. Our goal is to be fair and
                        consistent in our enforcement while maintaining a safe and positive environment for all users.
